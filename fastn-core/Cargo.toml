[features]
default = ["auth"]
# fastn comes with some feature to integrate with fastn controller. fastn controller is a
# separate software, optional. fastn controller is responsible for creating a new fastn
# package, and deploying it on some server, backing content up and so on. fastn has to
# speak with fastn controller, when fastn is managed by fastn controller. Enabling the
# "controller" feature enables that communication.
controller = ["remote"]

# fastn runs in local mode (to be used on your local laptop, or single use server), and in
# remote mode (to be used as a shared server for your entire team). The default is
# local mode.
#
# In local mode the editor acts like a local file editor, any changes done directly
# update the file. In remote mode, only sync can be called, and no direct edits are
# allowed. In future we will also have workspace mode, in which in remote a workspace
# is created for every user, and local edits in the workspace is allowed.

[dependencies]
# Please do not specify a dependency more precisely than needed. If version "1" works, do
# not specify "1.1.42". This reduces the number of total dependencies, as if you specify
# 1.1.42 and someone else who only needed "1" also specified 1.1.37, we end up having same
# dependency compiled twice.
#
# In future we may discover that our code does not indeed work with "1", say it ony works
# for 1.1 onwards, or 1.1.25 onwards, in which case use >= 1.1.25 etc. Saying our code
# only works for 1.1.42 and not 1.1.41 nor 1.1.43 is really weird, and most likely wrong.
#
# If you are not using the latest version intentionally, please do not list it in this section
# and create it's own [dependencies.<name>] section, and document it with why are you not
# using the latest dependency, and what is the plan.
